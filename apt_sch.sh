# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# üóìÔ∏è  Appointment Scheduler Script - Bash Version
#
# This script provides a command-line appointment scheduling system using 
# CSV files for persistent storage of user and appointment data.
#
# ‚û§ Features:
#   - User registration with unique username, password, full name, and profession.
#   - Secure user login with credential verification.
#   - Book appointments with other registered users (not yourself).
#   - View appointments you've booked or that are scheduled with you.
#   - Cancel your own booked appointments.
#   - Approve or reject pending appointments scheduled with you.
#   - View appointment statuses (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
#
# ‚û§ Data Storage:
#   - users.csv
#     Format: username,password,full_name,profession
#     Stores all user credentials and metadata.
#
#   - appointments.csv
#     Format: ID,BookedBy,Date,Time,WithWhom,ClientName,Reason,Status
#     Stores all appointments made by users.
#
# ‚û§ Script Workflow:
#   1. Checks if CSV files exist; creates them with headers if not.
#   2. Prompts user to Register or Login.
#   3. After login, shows a menu for appointment operations.
#   4. Each menu action interacts with the appropriate CSV file.
#   5. Uses temporary files to ensure safe read/write operations.
#
# ‚û§ Usage:
#   - Run the script in a Bash environment: ./apt_sch.sh
#   - Follow on-screen prompts to register, login, and manage appointments.
#
# ‚û§ Notes:
#   - Only the user who booked an appointment can cancel it.
#   - Only the user with whom the appointment is scheduled can approve/reject.
#   - All status changes are reflected in appointments.csv.
#   - Username must be unique during registration.
